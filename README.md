# Hi, I'm Marcos 👋

Senior Software Engineer based in Switzerland.

---

### What I'm into

- Hardcore agent engineer — building with opencode and Claude Code
- I love all things in the terminal: Neovim, dotfiles, and anything that lives in a shell
- Java, TypeScript, and Go by trade — PHP at heart
